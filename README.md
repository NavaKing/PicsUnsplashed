# PicsUnsplashed
Uses Unsplashed API to render images after doing a search

// Created a ReactAPP to learn the following:
// Used event handlers 
// taking an input tag and passing it in a callback function to a very 
// specifically named prop. then 
// whenever that tag immets that event 
// the call back function would be called. 

// Also passed a callback from the parent to 
// the child and then the child will call that callback.

// learned how to render a List using the map function. 
// by defining a key on the root element
// Reached into the DOM using the Ref system. 
// used the grid css system
